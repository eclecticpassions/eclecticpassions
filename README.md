# Hello there, I'm Naty 👩🏻‍💻👋🏻

👩🏻‍⚕️ I'm a junior healthcare professional by training, but currently exploring other interests. Based in 🇭🇰 Hong Kong, SAR.

## 🔭 Interests
  - Free open source software (FOSS) and raising awareness for privacy-centric services
  - Digital and film photography (favourite genres: street, urban, macro) / moving to FOSS post-processing options post-Adobe era
  - Speciality coffee / manual brewing / a "home barista" if you will
  - Home lab / self-hosting / Raspberry Pi (running dietpi)
  - Android + macOS and occasionally Linux Mint on my retired MBA 13" (2012)
  - Hiking / cycling / city walks / Formula 1

## 🌱 I’m currently
  -  Getting accustomed to being a 'sustainable blogger' (i.e. keeping up with posts without long periods of absences)
  -  Setting up a home-lab with a RPi4B (8GB) running Docker via Portainer
  -  Learning basic Python for data science
  -  Fine-tuning my personal knowledge management (PKM) system using Obsidian
  -  Transitioning my digital reliance towards more privacy-friendly options, moving away from Big Tech and US-based services in general
